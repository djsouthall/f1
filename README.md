# F1
A testbed for playing with F1 related data.  No specific purpose has been decided upon yet, but I hope to use this to play with both SQL databases and ML concepts with F1 related data as the object of play.  This uses the [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) package to access telemetry data.
