    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout a race the speed of an F1 car changes dramatically.  Maximized at the end of a straight before hard braking zones, with smooth acceleration out of each corner.  The speed v.s. time curve is the most iconic piece of telemetry used for interpreting a driver's lap quality.  Because each track has a distinct shape and unique combination of straights and corners, each telemetry trace tells a story of the circuit it belongs to; the signature of a track.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I demonstrate the ability to identify the circuit in question solely based off of this speed telemetry trace using a *Supervised Neural Network* trained a subset of laps obtained from the F1 2022 season using the [fastf1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Telemetry traces are obtained for each track using the [fastf1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1) package.  This tool does not provide data sampled at a regular rate, so some data cleaning is required for their use in this notebook.  This has been performed in advance using the functions provided by the [f1_djsouthall/tools/fastf1_tools.py](https://github.com/djsouthall/f1_djsouthall/blob/main/tools/fastf1_tools.py) script.  These laps are resampled to 0.1 second sampling, and all non-standard laps have been removed (i.e. laps with a safety car, yellow flags, pitstop in-lap, pitstop out-lap).  These standardized laps are loaded here and used for training the NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using the [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [keras](https://keras.io/) APIs to construct and train this model."
